              The founders of Four Oaks Farm began with a small plot and a grand
              idea: to provide organic living and make it available and
              reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Four Oaks Farm has made a loyal offline customer base over the
              years due to their dedication to sustainable farming and
              high-quality produce.
            </p>
            <p>
              As demand spread through word-of-mouth and farmers' markets around
              the area, manually handling orders became a challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having no background in online activities, they needed a digital
              platform that would do justice to their brand, streamline
              processes, and improve customer experience and for this they
              joined forces with Kushel Digi Solutions to create a modern
              eCommerce platform using BigCommerce.

              Four Oaks Farm encountered several challenges when shifting from
              offline to online:-
            </h5>
            <h5>1. Lack of technical expertise and digital infrastructure</h5>
            {/* <p>Selling firearms requires compliance with a Federal Firearms License. The business has to pass through age verification, location-based restrictions, and a lot of other things to be eligible to run an <b>E-commerce shopping</b>. </p> */}
            <h5>2. Challenge in demonstrating seasonal and variable stock</h5>
            {/* <p>The previous website had many issues, such as UI and UX design, performance, and improper infrastructure. It was becoming a hindrance to traffic growth and scalability.</p> */}
            <h5>
              3. Need for an visually appealing but simple user experience
            </h5>
            {/* <p>As the inventory is large, finding the right product is pretty difficult. The users have to struggle because no advanced filtering and search refinements are there. </p> */}
            <h5>4.Handling online payments, inventory, and orders</h5>
            {/* <p>Many of the potential customers exist on mobile, but the site wasn’t mobile-friendly. </p> */}

            <p className="s3theeparas">
              Kushel Digi Solutions created a custom eCommerce website for Four
              Oaks Farm on BigCommerce to build a robust online presence. The
              website had a clean, rustic look that reflected the organic nature
              of the farm while providing a user-friendly and hassle-free
              shopping experience. We integrated seasonal product offerings,
              flexible inventory management, and made sure the platform was
              completely responsive and mobile-compatible to reach more
              customers.
            </p>

            <p className="s3theeparas">
              In order to enhance operations, we incorporated secure payment
              gateways, real-time inventory visibility, and optimized backend
              processes. We also trained the farm staff to help them deal with
              orders, update products, and monitor stock with ease. This created
              a powerful, scalable platform that enabled Four Oaks Farm to
              transition to the digital age successfully and provide an improved
              service to customers.
            </p>
            <p className="s3theeparas">
              In order to enhance the backend processes, we incorporated
              real-time inventory monitoring, automated order management, and

            </p>

            <p className="s3theeparas">

                  management system to improve efficiency within the BigCommerce
                  platform. It helped Four Oaks Farm monitor real-time stock
                  levels, seasonally control product availability, automate
                  order statuses, and get low-stock notifications. This system
                  has effectively saved labor, eliminated errors, and enhanced
                  fulfillment efficiency, making it simpler for the team to meet
                  customer demand reliably.

                <h4>Mobile-First Approach</h4>
                <p>
                  With the realization of increasing mobile shoppers, we adopted
                  a mobile-first approach in development strategy. The site was
                  crafted to function seamlessly on all devices, particularly
                  smartphones and tablets—so that it would load fast, respond
                  well, and have touch-friendly navigation. This helped Four
                  Oaks Farm extend its reach and provide an smooth shopping
                  experience on whatever platform visitors were using.
